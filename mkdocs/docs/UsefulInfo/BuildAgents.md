# Build Agents

## Overview

Without a build agent, there isn't much you can do with ALOps.  The build agent is the machine that will execute the tasks you have defined in your pipeline.  The build agent can be hosted on-premises or in the cloud.  The choice of the build agent depends on the requirements of your pipeline.

## ALOps Build Agents

To make it convenient to you, we offer a service that provides the infrastructure for you.  The ALOps Build Agents are specialized in executing the DevOps tasks for Business Central.  The ALOps Build Agents are hosted OnPrem and are maintained by us.  This way, you don't have to worry about the infrastructure and can focus on your pipeline.
