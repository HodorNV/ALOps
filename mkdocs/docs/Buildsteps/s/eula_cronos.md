Hodor provides no warranty for any third-party software/hardware used or which connects with the Software. 
8.2	The Customer declares to have tested the Software and to be familiar with it. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Hodor does not provide any warranty regarding the Software.

9.	SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA)
9.1	Any agreements involving an SLA shall have to be agreed to in writing between the Parties and must be attached to this Agreement as Attachment 2.
9.2	The Customer will always inform Hodor of all circumstances that may affect its services and its availability. If agreements are made about a service level, then the availability measurement will not take into account:

9.3	Unless agreed otherwise, the availability as recorded by Hodor will be used as conclusive evidence.
9.4	As regards the service levels, a grace period of 6 months shall be in place, during which (i) no penalty or sanction is due and (ii) Hodor cannot be held liable for failure to meet the agreed service levels. During this grace period, Hodor is entitled to evaluate, update and adjust the service levels to ensure their optimal operation and availability. The grace period commences when the Software is made available to The Customer and the service begins. During this grace period, no penalties will be levied and Hodor can not be held liable for failure to reach said service levels.
10.	LIABILITY
10.1	Hodor will endeavour to provide the Services and, as applicable, the Customer access to the Software in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The liability that Hodor may incur in relation to this Agreement is derived from a best effort obligation which must be demonstrated by the Customer. 
10.2	Insofar as maximally permitted by applicable law, the total liability of Hodor based on attributable failure in the fulfilment of the Agreement is limited to the reimbursement of direct damages up to a maximum of the compensation owed by the Customer for the Services and/or Software that gave rise to the damages (excluding VAT). If the Agreement extends over multiple years, for the compensation of direct damages, Hodor may be held to a maximum of the value of the amounts invoiced for the performance of this Agreement for the Services and/or the Software (excluding VAT) over a period of twelve (12) months prior to the date that the damages-causing event occurred. Under no circumstances shall the total liability for all direct damages during the entire duration of the Agreement exceed the fee paid by the Customer for the Services and/or Software (excluding VAT). For damages incidents partly attributable to the Customer and/or a third party, Hodor may be held liable to the Customer up to a maximum amount, within the limits defined above, of the share caused by the Hodor's demonstrated error, to the exclusion of any joint and several liability with the other debtors. This provision applies regardless of whether the claim is brought on a contractual or extra-contractual basis. Related, similar or linked damages are always considered as a single damage case.
The foregoing does not apply to an infringement of the agreed SLA, for which the provisions of Attachment 2 apply exclusively and exclusively applicable (whereby the Customer may only be entitled to a Service Credit).
10.3	These maximum amounts apply regardless of whether the claim is brought on a contractual or extra-contractual basis. Related, similar or linked damages are always considered as a single damage case.
10.4	The Customer must inform Hodor in writing of any event that may incur its liability or any disadvantage that the Customer is undergoing. The Customer must do this within the time limit and at the latest within fifteen (15) days from the occurrence of this event or this disadvantage, or at least from the moment the Customer has had knowledge of this. This is in order to enable Hodor to determine the origin and cause(s) of the damage within a reasonable period. In the event of failure to comply with the written notification, Hodor reserves the right to refuse any compensation and cannot be held liable.
10.5	The following is explicitly excluded from liability:
(a)	compensation by Hodor for all indirect damages or consequential losses, including financial or commercial losses, loss of profit, increase of general costs, disruption of scheduling, loss of expected profit, capital, clientele, etc.
(b)	damage caused by a fault by the Customer and/or its end users;
(c)	compensation for all direct and indirect damage caused by the improper use of the Services and/or Software or through the use of the Services and/or Software in violation of the Terms of Use;

(e)	damage to the Customer, its end users and/or third parties arising from third party software and/or hardware.
(f)	Damage resulting from the non or improper installation of the tool provided by Hodor that grants access to the Software.

(i)	reimbursement of damage which was caused, in whole or in part, by software or hardware delivered or manufactured by third parties, or by any other element within the Customer or introduced to the Customer's company after the entry into force of the Agreement;
10.6	Although Hodor strives to protect the materials that contained in the Software, it cannot offer any guarantees as to the nature of the Internet. Except as otherwise agreed between the Parties, the Customer is responsible for the proper protection of its materials and/or those of its end users. In addition, Hodor has no specific knowledge of the materials stored in the Software, including the amount, nature, value or use thereof. The Customer should therefore take all reasonable steps to counteract any loss of data. For example, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Customer will be responsible for making the necessary backups of its materials. If the Parties explicitly agree that Hodor will be responsible for the backups, it will retain these backups for the duration of the agreed term of storage. In no event may Hodor be held liable for loss of information and/or data, insofar as this data has been changed since Hodor was commissioned under the Agreement to perform a backup. 
10.7	If the execution of the Agreement requires that the HodorSoftware connect to the Internet, Hodor will take all commercially viable measures to establish the Software's connection with the Internet. However, Hodor cannot be held responsible for the purchase and/or operation of the infrastructure of the Customer, its end users and/or other third parties.
10.8	Except as otherwise agreed between the Parties, the Customer is responsible for its use of the Services and/or Software and the manner in which the results of the Services and/or Software are deployed. The Customer is also responsible for instruction provided to and use by its end users.
10.9	Hodor will not be liable to the Customer for damage resulting from Force Majeure. 
11.	DURATION AND TERMINATION 
11.1	This Agreement shall enter into force on the day of its signature by all Parties, or the date of the initial deployment of the Software, in the event that this date precedes the date of the Agreement's signing. Deployment of the Software by the Customer is deemed to be its unconditional acceptance of this Agreement. 
11.2	This Agreement shall remain in force for a period of one (1) years. The term of the Agreement shall be tacitly extended for the duration of one (1) year, unless the Customer and/or Hodor terminate the Agreement in writing subject to a notice period of three (3) months prior to the end of the relevant period.

12.2	Upon such a termination of the Agreement, the Customer agrees to immediately destroy all programs and documentation relating to the Software, including copies made or obtained by the Customer, and discontinue further use of the Software. 
13.	PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION

The Customer remains solely responsible for the determination of the objectives for which Hodor processes personal data under this Agreement.

b)	Hodor will process only the personal data (i) according to the Customer's general or specific written instructions, or (ii) insofar as it is necessary (and only to the extent necessary) to perform this Agreement or (iii) ) as far as necessary on the basis of a legal obligation, with the understanding that Hodor will inform the Customer as far as possible; and
c)	impose on the persons acting under its authority the obligation to process personal data only on behalf of the Customer, unless required to do so by law; and

h)	lend all assistance to the supervisory authority; and
i)	inform the Customer without unreasonable delay of any unauthorised processing of personal data ('personal data breach notification') and cooperate with the Customer in the investigation and follow-up on this unauthorised processing; and

13.6	The Parties acknowledge that Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) implies that the substantive processing is defined. The Parties will draw up the necessary attachments and adjust them as necessary. 
14.	FORCE MAJEURE
14.1	Neither party is obliged to fulfil any obligation if prevented from doing so by force majeure (hereinafter 'Force Majeure'). Force Majeure is understood to mean a situation in which one of the Parties is impeded in the performance of the Agreement, either in whole or in part and temporarily or permanently, beyond the control or will of the Party. Without the intention of this being an exhaustive list, the following circumstances are considered as cases of force majeure: force majeure experienced by subcontractors or third parties appointed by Hodor, any government measures or restrictions, government decisions, government actions or failure to act (e.g. delays or failure to issue or retract a license, grant or authorisation), special weather conditions and natural disasters, earthquakes, lightning, hurricanes, floods, fire, explosions, epidemics, electricity interference, internet interruption, computer network or telecommunications facilities, the unavailability of third party servers and/or third parties, bugs in third-party software, general scarcity of commodities or goods (e.g. electricity, water, gas, etc.), war (declared or undeclared), embargoes, hostilities, unrest, riots, civil turmoil, sabotage, act of a public enemy, terrorist attacks, quarantine measures, strikes or lock-outs, labour disputes, general trade and transport problems, export and import barriers, machine and material defects (and this regardless of whether force majeure occurs at Hodor or at one of its suppliers).

Further use of the Software implies the unconditional and irrevocable acceptance of the modified terms.
