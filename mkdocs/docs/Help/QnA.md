# Q & A

## Do I need a license to run ALOps?
Yes and No.  It depends on the situation:
- No - if you run anything for community, which means, if you want to run pipelines on public repositories, the use of ALOps is completely free
- Yes - For any private repository, you need to pay for ALOps.  

More information on ALOps pricing, you can find [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Hodor.hodor-alops&ssr=false#pricing).

## Do I need to use Docker
No - all ALOps steps can run without Docker as well.  Though, we strongly recommend to use Docker, which will give you a much more stable build-experience.
