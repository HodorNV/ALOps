Welcome to ALOps, an extension for Microsoft Azure DevOps, that provides building blocks for easily setting up build pipelines for AL Language Extensions, aka "Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Extensions". 

These building can be used to create a build pipeline for your AL Language Extension, that will build your extension, publish it to a Dynamics 365 Business Central Server, run tests on the server, and much more!  A list of all the buildsteps can be found [here](/ALOpsSteps/Buildstepsv1/).

## Getting Started
